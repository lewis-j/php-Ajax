Application Description

This is a surf forecasting application that is more community driven than current prevalent surf reporting websites. 
Most surf reporting websites have reports that are submitted by  selected arbiters from different regions. The metrics 
used for determining a 1 to 5 star rating are often times not as accurate as what is experienced at a location. I'd like
to design a web application that is constantly taking in user submitted ratings and reports in order to update the metric
for predicting reports and creating accurate ratings for forecast. I'd also like to allow for community members to submit
their own reports for their local spot which will be sorted on a report summary page based on reputation. This reputation
will be calculated from other users input on how accurate they assess the report to be. 

The intended audience for my web application is any oceanic enthusiast that  rely on accurate surf report data. 
If they feel like the current report summaries and ratings for these websites are not as accurate as they hoped and 
would like a chance to give their input than this site could be that opportunity.
